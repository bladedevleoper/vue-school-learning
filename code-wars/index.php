// a narcisstic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.


// 153 is a narcisstic number
// it depends on the amount of digits the number has you raise it to the power of the count of those digits
// 153 has 3 digits, so we take each digit and raise it to the power of 3
// 1 power of 3 + 5 power of 3 + 3 power of 3 (we add these up)

// in mathematical terms, power of 3 is known as 'cubed', this means times the number of itself
// 5 cubed is 5 * 5 *5 which then equals 125
