Vue Mastery Notes:

Vue has a virtual Dom
- the virtual dom is a way of representing the actual dom with javascript objects.


for example:

dom element:

<div>Hello</div>

Virtual Node within Vue:

{
    tag: "div",
    children: [
        {
            text: "Hello",
        }
    ]
}

Vue takes this javascript object and turns renders it through the render function, if a component changes it is then sent back into vue to compare and it makes updates in the efficient way.

Vue has 3 modules:

1. Reactivity Module:

- allows us to create javascript reactive objects that can be watched for changes.
- these objects are watched and also tracked, so if anything does happen the code is ran with these updates.


2. Compiler Module:

- this module takes html templates and compiles them into render functions.
- this can happen in the brower at runtime.
- but more or less happens when a vue project is built.


3. Renderer Module:

- this module contains 3 different phases of rendering out a component onto a web page.

the three phases are:
1. The Render Phase:

- The render function is called and a virtual DOM node is returned

2. The Mount Phase:

- The render takes the virtual DOM node and makes DOM javascript calls to make a web page.

3. The Patch Phase:

- The render takes the old virtual and takes the new virutual node and compares them. It will only update the parts that are required.
